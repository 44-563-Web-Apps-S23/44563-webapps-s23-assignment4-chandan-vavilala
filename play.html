        <h4>SCENE:</h4>
             <p class="direction"> [_A corner of a ladies' restaurant; two small tables of
            cast-iron, a sofa covered with red plussh, and a few chairs._]</p>
       
        <h6 class="MRS_X ">MRS. X. :</h6>
            <p class="direction"> [_enters, dressed in hat and winter coat, and carrying a
            pretty Japanese basket on her arm_.] </p>
       
        <h6 class="MISS_Y ">MISS Y. :</h6> 
            <p class="direction">[_in front of her a partly emptied bottle of beer; she
            is reading an illustrated weekly, and every now and then, she
            exchanges it for a new one_.]</p>
       
        <h6 class="MRS_X">MRS. X. :</h6> 
            <p class="speech">Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as
               lonely as a poor bachelor.</p>
       
        <h6 class="MISS_Y">MISS Y. :</h6>
            <p class="direction">[_looks up from the paper for a moment, nods, and resumes
                her reading_.]</p> 
       
        <h6 class="MRS_X">MRS. X. :</h6> 
            <p class="speech">Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a
                restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of all times. It makes me as sad as
                when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was
                reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the
                witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end?
                Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going
                to say that she was reading a comic paper--- that's a different case, my
                dear.</p>
       
            <p class="direction">[_A waitress brings a cup of chocolate, places it before_ MRS. X., _and disappears again_.]</p>
       
        <h6 class="MRS_X ">MRS. X. :</h6>  
            <p class="direction">[_Sips a few spoonfuls; opens the basket and displays a number
                of Christmas presents._] </p>
                <p class="speech">See what I've bought for my tots.</p>
            <p class="direction">[_Picks up a doll._] </p>
            <p class="speech">What do you think of this? Lisa is to have it. She can roll her
                eyes and twist her head, do you see? Fine, is it not? And here's a cork
                pistol for Carl.</p>
            <p class="direction">[_Loads the pistol and pops it at_ MISS Y.]</p>

        <h6 class="MISS_Y">MISS Y. :</h6> 
            <p class="direction">[_starts as if frightened_.]</p>
       
        <h6 class="MRS_X">MRS. X. :</h6> 
            <p class="speech"> Did I scare you? Why, you didn't fear I was going to shoot you,
                did you? Really, I didn't think you could believe that of me. If you
                were to shoot _me_--well, that wouldn't surprise me the least. I've got
                in your way once, and I know you'll never forget it--but I couldn't help
                it. You still think I intrigued you away from the Royal Theatre, and I
                didn't do anything of the kind--although you think so. But it doesn't
                matter what I say, of course--you believe it was I just the same.</p>
                <p class="direction">[_Pulls out a pair of embroidered slippers._] </p>
                <p class="speech"> Well, these are for my hubby--tulips--I've embroidered them myself. H'm!--I hate tulips--and he
                must have them on everything.</p>
       
        <h6 class="MISS_Y">MISS Y. :</h6> 
            <p class="direction">[_looks up from the paper with an expression of mingled
                sarcasm and curiosity_.]</p>
       
        <h6 class="MRS_X">MRS. X. :</h6> 
            <p class="direction">[_Puts a hand in each slipper._]</p>
            <p class="speech"> Just see what small feet Bob has. See? And you should see him walk--elegant! Of course, you've never
                 seen him in slippers. </p>
