       <h6 class="MRS_X">MRS. X.</h6> 
       <p class="speech">Look here--here he comes.</p>
       
           <p class="direction"> [_Makes the slippers walk across the table._ MISS Y. _laughs
            again_.]</p>
       
       <h6 class="MRS_X">MRS. X.</h6>
       <p class="speech"> Then he gets angry, and he stamps his foot just like this:
       "Blame that cook who can't learn how to make coffee." Or: "The
       idiot--now that girl has forgotten to fix my study lamp again." Then
       there is a draught through the floor and his feet get cold. "Gee, but
       it's freezing, and those blanked idiots don't even know enough to keep
       the house warm."</p>
       
         <p class="direction">[_She rubs the sole of one slipper against the instep of the
            other._ MISS Y. _breaks into prolonged laughter_.]</p>
       
       <h6 class="MRS_X">MRS. X.</h6>
       <p class="speech">And then he comes home and has to hunt for his slippers--Mary
       has pushed them under the bureau. Well, perhaps it is not right to be
       making fun of one's own husband. He's pretty good for all that--a real
       dear little hubby, that's what he is. You should have such a
       husband--what are you laughing at? Can't you tell? Then, you see, I know
       he is faithful. Yes, I know, for he has told me himself--what in the
       world makes you giggle like that? That nasty Betty tried to get him away
       from me while I was on the road. Can you think of anything more
       infamous? </p>
       <p class="direction">[_Pause._]</p>
       <p class="speech">But I'd have scratched the eyes out of her face,
       that's what I'd have done, if I had been at home when she tried it.</p>
       <p class="direction">[_Pause._] </p>
       <p class="speech">I'm glad Bob told me all about it, so I didn't have to hear
       it first from somebody else. </p>
       <p class="direction">[_Pause._] </p>
       <p class="speech">And, just think of it, Betty was
       not the only one! I don't know why it is, but all women seem to be crazy
       after my husband. It must be because they imagine his government
       position gives him something to say about the engagements. Perhaps
       you've tried it yourself--you may have set your traps for him, too? Yes,
       I don't trust you very far--but I know he never cared for you--and then
       I have been thinking you rather had a grudge against him.</p>
       
         <p class="direction"> [_Pause. They look at each other in an embarrassed manner._]</p>
       
       <h6 class="MRS_X">MRS. X.</h6>
       <p>Amelia, spend the evening with us, won't you? Just to show that
       you are not angry--not with me, at least. I cannot tell exactly why, but
       it seems so awfully unpleasant to have you--you--for an enemy. Perhaps
       because I got in your way that time [_rallentando_] or--I don't
       know--really, I don't know at all---- </p>
